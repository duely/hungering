# Hungering

Provides a rotten carrot that can be eaten at any time and which gives the Hunger debuff for 6 seconds.

The rotten carrot can then be used, in combination with 4 wooden planks and a block of iron, create a torc. The torc can be activated to drain satiation (actual "fed" icons) immediately, or sneak-right-click activated to drain "fed" over time.

Each activation (whether manual or automatic) will also consume durability.

The maximum durability, frequency of automatic hunger ticks, "fed" consumed (1 = 1/2 a "fed" icon), whether the torc recipe is enabled, and whether the torc and rotten carrot can be found in loot chests can be configured.
